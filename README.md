# Adobe XD Grid
This is a simple responsive grid template for Adobe XD. XD itself doesn't offer any kind of grid or layout settings (as of October 2017). So we built our own responsive grid template for our design and prototyping projects.

## Features

#### Default Resolutions

* Desktop – 1480x960px
* Tablet – 768x1024px
* Mobile – 360x640

#### 8pt Grid Support

We are working with the glorious 8-Point-Grid System. This mean all dimensions, columns, baselines and margins are defined as a multiple of 8. [Learn more about the 8-Point Grid](https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid). 

#### Repeating Grid
The template is designed as repeating grid. This means you can easily change the size and amount of columns, as well as the gutter width in between.
